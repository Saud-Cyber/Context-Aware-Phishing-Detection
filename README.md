Context-Aware Phishing Detection using Machine Learning and Sender Behavior Analysis

Link : https://phishing-project-fgkpte5dtgxspldaqkhh8e.streamlit.app/

This project implements a context-aware phishing detection system that combines email content analysis with sender behavioral profiling. Unlike traditional text-only phishing detectors, this system integrates linguistic features, structural indicators, and sender trust history to produce a more informed and explainable prediction.

Overview

Phishing emails attempt to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, financial details, or confidential data. Modern phishing attacks often use well-written and professional language, making text-only detection models less reliable. Many systems focus purely on email content and ignore who is sending the email and how that sender has behaved historically.

This project addresses that gap by incorporating both content-based features and sender behavior into a unified classification framework.

Core Idea

The system operates on two main pillars:

What the email says

Who is sending it and how they have behaved before

Email content is processed using a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text into numerical features. Structural characteristics such as number of URLs, presence of IP-based links, suspicious top-level domains, exclamation frequency, uppercase ratio, and urgency-related language are extracted. Additionally, a dynamic sender trust score is computed based on historical behavior. These features are combined and fed into a trained machine learning model to classify the email as phishing or legitimate.

System Architecture

The pipeline follows these steps:

Text Vectorization
The email body is transformed using a trained TF-IDF vectorizer.

Structural Feature Extraction
The system extracts measurable risk indicators from the raw email content, including:

Number of URLs

Number of unique domains

Presence of IP-based URLs

Suspicious top-level domains

Exclamation mark frequency

Uppercase character ratio

Urgency-related keywords

Sender Trust Modeling
A sender trust score is retrieved from historical statistics. If the sender has no history, a global prior is assigned. This models real-world cold-start scenarios.

Feature Fusion
Text features and scaled numeric features are combined into a single feature vector.

Classification
A trained machine learning model outputs the phishing probability and final prediction.
